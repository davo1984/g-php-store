## About this Year
One year ago this month we had to put our 17 year old dog down due to major health problems. Spot had a good and long life, collies live to about 14 years normally. Unfortunately the year quickly spiraled downhill ever since, then the pandemic hit. Here's hoping next year is better, much better.
